# processing-experiments

This is exactly what it sounds like: I started playing around with Processing and Processing.js, and I'm having fun and want to share.

To see my favorites, visit http://kenbellows.github.io/processing-experiments/ and select a sketch from the dropdown at the top.

My absolute favorite so far is "galaxy-swarm". Give it a minute to get going; it swirls up into vertical vortex encasing a Great Eye, then emerges the FSM himself in all his noodley glory.
(I stumbled upon it due to a typo in my attempts to create "starfish_and_roses".)
