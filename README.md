# processing-experiments

This is exactly what it sounds like: I started playing around with Processing and Processing.js, and I'm having fun and want to share.

To see my favorites, visit http://kenbellows.github.io/processing-experiments/ and select a sketch from the dropdown at the top.

My absolute favorite so far is [galaxy-swarm](http://kenbellows.github.io/processing-experiments/#/sketch/galactic_swarm).
Give it a minute to get going; it swirls up into vertical vortex encasing the Great Eye, then emerges
the [FSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster) himself in all his noodley glory.
(I stumbled upon it due to a typo in my attempts to create [starfish_and_roses](http://kenbellows.github.io/processing-experiments/#/sketch/starfish_and_roses).)
