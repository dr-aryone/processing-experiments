/*
watch the rest happen as it does
watch the sky down as it blows
where the wind rises and falls is the where that you find when your mind is all gone

when you need taxes and faxes and time
then you rise higher than filing and lies
can you make nonsense of sensible plays?
entering contests is never the ways

walri and balri and fallri in time
care i or dare i mean playgrounds and crime?
callround the background and factround the bend
energy means the la la la la lay
